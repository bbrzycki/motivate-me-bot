@MotivateMeBot is a Twitter bot that tries to make motivational pictures by combining content from other tweets!

Example scripts located in `scripts/`! Specifically, `create_image_from_twitter.py` runs the tweet scraping / image & text editing pipeline. 

To run on your local machine, you'll need a Twitter Developer account and place the (4) keys in a file called `keys.py` within the `motivate_me_bot/` directory.
